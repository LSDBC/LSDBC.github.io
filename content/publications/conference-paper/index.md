abstract: This article attempts to reintegrate the role of responsibility-sensitivity withing egalitarian theories of justice by comparing two approaches to distributive justice: luck egalitarianism and the capability approach. Three major shortcomings of the capability approach are outlined: its absence of a consistent basis of equality; its propensity to foster paternalist practices; its commitment to sufficientism, potentially leading to stalemates in compensating individuals. The article proposes a redefinition of the concept of responsibility, allowing to define an enhanced version of luck egalitarianism potentially capable of including forward-looking concerns in a mostly deontological theory of justice.
