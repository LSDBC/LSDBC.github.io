Hi! I'm Lorenzo, a PhD student in Economics at Pompeu Fabra University, specializing in monetary macroeconomics from a New Keynesian and New Monetarist perspective. I'm a theoretically inclined researcher, interested in numerical methods, expectations and learning algorithm, and deep learning to solve equilibrium models in economics.
